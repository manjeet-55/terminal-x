# TerminalX

## Requirements:
- NodeJS >= v16 and NPM

## Setup process
There are two parts to this, the frontend and backend, just like a typical web application.

To get the backend running use the following steps:

- `cd` into the directory.
- Run `npm install` to pull in dependencies.
- Run `node backend.js` to start the WebSocket the frontend will be connecting to.
- Open `index.html` to start frontend in browser  **OR**  Run `node test.js` to start frontend(It will help to keep frontend alive in background)
